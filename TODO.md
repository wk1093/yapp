- [x] Fix anonymous struct handling
- [x] Fix typedefs for NON-anonymous structs
- [x] Class members are always inline right now, fix this
- [x] BIG: Template handling
- [x] Get C++ stdlib headers to work: just use #pub include for most things
- [x] Separate big functions into smaller more manageable ones
- [x] Unit tests for simple behavior that should be easy to test (pub vs priv, default visibility, etc.)
- [ ] Add more unit tests
- [x] Custom inclusion system for including another yapp file instead of using #include "myfile.yapp.h"
- [ ] maybe? Build system that will automatically build dependencies of the main yapp file
- [x] BIG: Fix "using" to be default private and work properly.
- [ ] HUGE: Ensure ALL C++ language features work correctly.
- [ ] HUGE: Fix class/struct members to be defined in the source and declared in the header. This will require a LOT of work.
- [x] BIG: Fix default parameters. Should only show up in the header, not the source (if it is split into header/source).
- [ ] HUGE: Stdlib automatic flags. It would be nice to be able to include the YAPP stdlib without having to specify a bunch of flags.
- [ ] HUGE: Fix the CMake build system to be more robust and easier to read.
- [ ] BIG: Filesystem lib.
- [ ] BIG: Algorithm lib.
- [ ] BIG: Regex lib.

Eventual Goals:
- [ ] Have the compiler source use NO C++ stdlib at all, just use the YAPP stdlib.
